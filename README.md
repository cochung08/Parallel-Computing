This is a collection of all the projects done in TJHSST's [Parallel Computing 1] (https://fcps.tjhsst.edu/coursemgmt/courses/300/course/3199T1/#3199T1) and [2] (https://fcps.tjhsst.edu/coursemgmt/courses/300/course/3199T2/#3199T2) courses. <br \>
Parallel is taught in a UNIX environment. The language is C with applications of OpenMP, MPI and Cuda. <br \>
Each course is one semester long; specifically taken Fall 2012 and Spring 2013. <br \>
[Dr. Shane Torbert] (http://www.tjhsst.edu/~smtorbert/) was the instructor for this course.
