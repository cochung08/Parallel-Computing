To send an array in mpi, don't use &a. Use a and for size (the item following &a normally being 1), use the # of elements in the array. build array.
Only recieve in the i component; receive the array of stuff. Loop over the colors. Only really need myX since you have all myY. First batch of recieve needs to be careful though...
First batch of send with send first three columns. Then problem above is okay.
The color-setting/pixel-filling needs to have a loop over all of j.
^Should significantly decrease overhead and increase speed to faster than current (and faster than serial).
