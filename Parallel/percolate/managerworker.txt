Your percolate program and plot
should both be working, first.

Now the question is how to generate
the same plot (or a high resolution
portion of part of it) using MPI.

EASIEST
Manager sends each Worker a probability,
the grid dimensions, and number of trials.
Worker calculates the spanning percentage
and sends it to the Manager.  Then the
Manager sends the Worker a new probability,
dimensions, trials (i.e., another problem)
for the Worker to solve and send back.

This process of send, calculate, send back,
continues between the Manager and each of
the Workers until all the tasks are done.

Then the Manager can send a "kill signal"
to each of the Workers so they know that
it is time to go home for the day.

Alternatively, slice the probability range
at the start to minimize sends/recvs, but
it is not obvious that all such slices will
require the same amount of computation, so
the workload may not be balanced.

MEDIUM
For a single probability, spread the trials
among multiple Workers.  Now the spanning
percentage must be accumulated step-by-step
by the Manager, but the work will balance.

HARDEST
For a single trial, spread the grid among
multiple Workers.  Now the Workers will need
to communicate among themselves to determine
if even one single trial spanned or not.
